# Text_Mining_airbnb_predictions
This repository contains the project done for the Text Mining course that is part of the MDSAA @NOVAIMS

The focus of the project is to predict if an Airbnb property will be unlisted in the next quarter, taking into consideration text features such as descriptions, comments (...);

The final notebook contains the whole process of turning such features into valuable insights and predictions!
